# Advent of Code 2020

## Day 1

- 2sum: hash table

- 3sum: two pointers

## Day 2

- strings

## Day 3

- arrays

## Day 4

- strings. ```string.hexdigits``` and ```string.digits``` came in handy.

## Day 14

- strings

- arrays

- enumeration

## Day 15

- hash table

## Day 16

- Intersting one. Part 2 feels like solving linear equation systems, i.e. after LU-Factorization, we will end up with equations with 1, 2, 3, ..., n variables and then we can tackle them one by one.

## Day 17

- Multi-dimensional array. Feels like one problem from last year.

## Day 19

- Regular expression / context free grammar?

- I tried use Python's re module but somehow my implementation is too slow

- Watched [GeoHots' stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxDp11u-GUo) to learn part 2

## Day 23

- Linked list. I implememnted using array and the run time is crazy. Still feeling very stupid on this one.

## Day 24

- Modleing the envrionment with a coordinate system

- Learnt from [twitch stream of anthonywritescode](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/848239372) on how to handle this type of "infinitely expanding problem"
