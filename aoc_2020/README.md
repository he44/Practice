# Advent of Code 2020

## Day 1

- 2sum: hash table

- 3sum: two pointers

## Day 2

- strings

## Day 3

- arrays

## Day 4

- strings. ```string.hexdigits``` and ```string.digits``` came in handy.

## Day 5

- Binary search

## Day 6

- set operation: union (```|```) and intersection (```&```)

## Day 7

- Graph

- part 1 is easy, writing a DFS in iterative fashion

- part 2 (I think) can be done with level-based BFS (written in an iterative fashion), so that we can multiply the number of bags over. I ended up writing the recursion though.

## Day 8

- set

## Day 9

- dp maybe? sliding window?

## Day 10

- Tried using backtracking but took forever on the actual input

- Learnt from [this YouTube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cE88K2kFZn0) and rewrote the thing in DP

## Day 14

- strings

- arrays

- enumeration

## Day 15

- hash table

## Day 16

- Intersting one. Part 2 feels like solving linear equation systems, i.e. after LU-Factorization, we will end up with equations with 1, 2, 3, ..., n variables and then we can tackle them one by one.

## Day 17

- Multi-dimensional array. Feels like one problem from last year.

## Day 19

- Regular expression / context free grammar?

- I tried use Python's re module but somehow my implementation is too slow

- Watched [GeoHots' stream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OxDp11u-GUo) to learn part 2

## Day 23

- Linked list. I implememnted using array and the run time is crazy. Still feeling very stupid on this one.

## Day 24

- Modleing the envrionment with a coordinate system

- Learnt from [twitch stream of anthonywritescode](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/848239372) on how to handle this type of "infinitely expanding problem"
